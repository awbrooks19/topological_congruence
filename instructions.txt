Instructions for running the topological analysis scripts.

Make a folder and change the outPath= variable in the python script to point to that folder.
Within the folder place your two trees labeled:
	ht.newick = Host Phylogeny
	mt.newick = Microbiome Dendrogram
	*** Alternatively you can change the htPath and mtPath to point to trees at different locations.

Run the script!
