Instructions for running the topological analysis scripts.

1. Make a folder named your project.
2. Change the outPath= variable in the python script (or jupyter notebook) to point to that folder.
3. Within the folder place your two trees labeled:
	ht.newick = Host Phylogeny
	mt.newick = Microbiome Dendrogram
	*** Alternatively you can change the htPath and mtPath to point to trees at different locations.

4. Run the script (or execute cells sequentially in notebook)! Results will be output using print().
